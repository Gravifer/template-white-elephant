\usepackage{array} % do not use due to \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/213088/amsmath-matrix-vs-loading-the-array-package}
\usepackage{dcolumn} % allows alignment at decimal points
\usepackage{hhline}

\usepackage{supertabular} % jolly old many-pages table support
\usepackage{longtable} % a superseder; but have a few more problems. do not use this inside a multicol, and you are basically good to go

% \usepackage{slashbox} % needs direct attention
\usepackage{multirow} % the multicol package is in layout.tex and is not for tables
\usepackage{bigstrut}
\usepackage{bigdelim}
\usepackage{makecell}

\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{xltabular}

% colorful tables
\usepackage{tcolorbox}
\usepackage{colortbl}
% the xcolor package also have related features

% \usepackage{mdwtab} % This reimplementation of the tabular and array environments re-does what the array package does, but in a way that builds on a reimplementation of the tabular and array functionality within the LATEX kernel itself. Among many improvements claimed for the package is that there are no built-in column types: all column types are explicitly declared within the package. 
%! This, though very neat, introduces serious incompatibility with the aforementioned packages.
