%! hyper-referencing: load them last!
\usepackage{nameref} % mustr be loaded before hyperref
\usepackage{hypbmsec}
\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}
\usepackage{xr, xr-hyper} % external references
\usepackage[unicode,plainpages=false,hidelinks,pdfpagelabels]{hyperref} % unless explicitly required, load this after any other package; the plainpages option is turned off to make it compatible with roman page labels; when the backref option is given, the backref package is loaded (incompatible with biblatex, which also provides back referencing)

\usepackage{cleveref} %! must come after the hyperref package; it is state-of-the-art fully-dynamic cross-referencing package; indispensible!
%! Some caveats when using the cleveref package:
%! The package is seriously incompatible with the showonlyrefs option of the mathtools package. By "seriously incompatible" I mean that if cleveref is loaded together with \usepackage[showonlyrefs]{mathtools}, not only will the \cref commands containing labels of equation objects be messed up, but many other cross-referencing packages will also experience major problems. Fortunately, this problem appears to be the only incompatibility between the cleveref and mathtools packages.
%! If both the footmisc and the hyperref packages are loaded, there are some unresolved incompatibilities that affect cross-references to footnotes. This problem also affects a variety of other packages that provide cross-referencing functions, including cleveref.
%! If your document loads the babel package with the option french, be sure not to use : ("colon") in the arguments of any \label and \cref-family instructions. This is because (a) the babel-french combination makes the : character "active" and (b) \cref needs to perform various operations on its argument: these operations will crash if the : character is active.
% \usepackage{amsrefs} % must be loaded after the hyperref package (unclear right now what it does); incompatible with biblatex
% \usepackage{autonum} %! arranges that equation numbers are applied only to those equations that are referenced (thus remedies clash between the cleveref package and the showonlyref option of the mathtool package); sadly it requires the obsolete etextool package, and clashes with biblatex; must be loaded after hyperref and cleveref

% \usepackage{enumitem-zref} % unclear right now
\usepackage[perpage,user]{zref} % may be the next-generation cross-referencing method
